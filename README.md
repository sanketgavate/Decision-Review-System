# Decision-Review-System
The system works by analyzing video footage using image processing techniques. It first detects the crease line and the batsmanâ€™s position. Then, it identifies the moment the bails are removed from the stumps. For this, I used techniques like object detection to locate the batsman and motion detection to identify when the bails were dislodged.
